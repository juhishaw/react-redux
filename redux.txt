- 3rd party library to manage global state
- Standalone libraray but east to integrate with reactv apps using react-redux library
- All global satte is stored in one globally accessible store, which is easy to update using action(like useReducer)
- Context API + useReducer
- Classic Redux | Modern redux toolkit

### Mechanism ###
Event handler in comp --> Action creator function (To automate writing action. Helpful to kepp all possible actions in one central place) --> dispatch
    --> Stor(collection of reducer, action goes here after its created) --> Next State --> Re-render
